# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, I appreciate any kind of help to make this project better and widespread by Raspberry Pi enthusiasts.

## Requesting features

Feel free to ask for new features using the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/rembertmagri/pi-control-panel/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

## Reporting Bugs

Report any bugs you find when using and developing using the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/rembertmagri/pi-control-panel/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/rembertmagri/pi-control-panel/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, try to follow the PR template as much as possible. Keep in mind that every project can always use more test coverage, and please follow our coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Rembert Magri
